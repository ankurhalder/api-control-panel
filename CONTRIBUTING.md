### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ankurhalder/api-control-panel/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ankurhalder/api-control-panel/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

1.  Open a new issue with a clear title and description of the proposed enhancement.
2.  Explain why this enhancement would be useful to other users.
3.  Provide a code sample or mockups if possible to illustrate the new feature.

We welcome pull requests!

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure your code lints (if a linter is configured).
